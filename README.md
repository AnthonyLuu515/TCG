TCG Collector 
Collecting items became bigger during covid and wanted to be able to keep track of what I have.  In which I would like a way to see and sort the collection by name, rarity or by value. 

During the first day of building the program. I focus on the figuring out how to use data different data structures and decided with using a priority queue to keep the list rarity sorted but also using a hashmap for ease of looking up values.  On the second day I focused on getting the methods in the card class to take values and use a comparator of a switch case for rarity.   

Building the data base class was next, adding the methods I wanted to do with the input and card class attributes.  Adding cards to both the data bases then using a insertion sort to sort it base on which value.  I can stuck with the hashmap since I couldn’t add multiples of the same cards in the map and printing it out, so when I called the hash map I added it to array to be printed out. 

After completed the skeleton of the code,  unit testing was implemented on some functions of add, remove, and print. It covered most the program, testing the insertion sort came to be difficult so I moved on to building the GUI, it was fun to tackle gui for the first time and frustrating like learning JAVA for the first time this semester.  The thought behind the gui was to add buttons to initalize cards being into the data base then use other buttons to mess with it. Would it be to remove or sort it base on which button.  I had trouble understanding how to write action listeners and more so with panel I was gonna use for outputting the data base since I based it mostly on storing and calling from memory. 

USER MANUAL 
ADD CARD Values into the text fields.
Upon conclusion of the program. Things I would change is to another data structures besides hashmap or use another value so If I have multiples of a “card” I would be able to pull it out of the data structure.  I’m unfamilar with java let alone gui’s that I ran out of time to figure out how to get the data into a JTable or Jtextfield, so settle with using the IDE console.  I would try to figure out the finalized polish form more than the skeleton and building.
